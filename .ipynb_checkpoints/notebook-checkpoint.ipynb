    "# **Hate Speech and Offensive Content Detection**\n",

    "## **1. Business Understanding**\n",
    "### *Overview*\n",
    "In Kenya's digital landscape, Twitter plays a critical role in shaping public discourse, especially during election seasons and politically charged events. While it provides a platform for civic engagement, it also facilitates the spread of hate speech, tribalism, and inciting language. This content can escalate tensions and contribute to real-world conflict if left unchecked.\n",
    "### *Challenges*\n",
    "Manually moderating large volumes of tweets is inefficient and prone to bias. Current moderation systems struggle to scale and often miss localized forms of hate speech, particularly those specific to Kenyan cultural and political contexts. There is also a lack of automated tools specifically designed to detect offensive content within Kenyan tweets.\n",
    "### *Proposed Solution*\n",
    "Develop a machine learning model that can automatically categorize tweets into three classes: hate speech, offensive content, or neither. The model will serve as a content flagging tool for:\n",
    "Early detection of harmful tweets during elections or national events.\n",
    "Support for content moderation teams at media outlets, regulatory bodies, and social platforms.\n",
    "Enhancing digital safety by tracking the evolution and spread of dangerous speech trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective classification model tailored to the Kenyan context can reduce the spread of inciting content and improve the quality of online public discourse. This system would be vital in promoting peace, especially during sensitive periods like elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Problem Statement*\n",
    "There is an urgent need for a localized and scalable hate speech detection system to flag inciting and offensive tweets in Kenya, particularly during political periods where online speech can incite real-world unrest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Objectives*\n",
    "- To evaluate the most common terms or phrases used in inciting tweets.\n",
    "- To build a multi-class classification model that labels tweets as hate speech, offensive, or neither.\n",
    "- To evaluate model performance across different algorithms using F1 score.\n",
    "- To Deploy the best performing model using Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2 Data Understanding**\n",
    "The dataset used in this project, HateSpeech_Kenya.csv, was sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform for sharing datasets and machine learning challenges.Here is the link to the dataset [HateSpeech.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edwardombui/hatespeech-kenya/data?select=HateSpeech_Kenya.csv) It contains approximately 48,000 tweets labeled for sentiment and hate speech, specifically focused on the Kenyan social and political context.\n",
    "Key Features of the Data:\n",
    "- `tweet`: The raw text of the tweet . this forms the primary input for natural language processing and classification tasks.\n",
    "- `label`: The target variable, where 0 represents neutral content and 1 represents offensive content and 2 represent hate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is directly aligned with the project goal of developing a machine learning model to detect and categorize hate speech in Kenyan tweets. The inclusion of localized language, real-world offensive content, and metadata allows the model to learn patterns specific to the Kenyan context.\n"

    "Overall, the distributions are quite similar, with all three classes—Neutral, Offensive, and Hate Speech—showing a median length slightly above 100 characters. The interquartile ranges are also comparable, though Hate Speech tweets appear slightly shorter on average. All classes contain a large number of outliers above 200 characters, indicating some very long tweets in each category. This suggests that tweet length alone may not strongly differentiate between sentiment classes."

    "The boxplot displays the distribution of tweet lengths (in words) across the three sentiment categories. All three classes—Neutral, Offensive, and Hate Speech—have fairly similar distributions, with median word counts around 20. The interquartile ranges also overlap significantly, suggesting that tweet length by word count does not strongly differentiate between the sentiment classes. However, all categories show a wide range of outliers, indicating that some tweets are much longer than average, especially in the Neutral and Offensive categories."

    "All three classes generally contain short tweets, mostly between 1 and 3 sentences. The median sentence count is consistent across categories at around 2, with very similar interquartile ranges, suggesting uniform tweet length regardless of sentiment. However, Neutral tweets exhibit more extreme outliers, with some reaching up to 14 sentences, indicating occasional long-form content. Offensive and Hate Speech tweets also show outliers but to a lesser extent. This implies that while most tweets are brief, Neutral tweets are more likely to include longer discourse."

    "The word cloud highlights the most frequently used terms across tweets, with larger font sizes indicating higher word frequency. Prominent words like \"kikuyus\", \"noreformsnoelections\", \"luo\", \"kenya\", and \"hate\" suggest a strong emphasis on ethnic identity, political slogans, and polarizing language. Terms such as \"kill\", \"know\", and \"dont\" also appear, indicating some aggressive or opinionated tone in the discourse. The presence of multiple ethnic group names — including \"kalenjins\", \"luhyas\", and \"nyakundi\" — reinforces the role of tribal identity in the conversation. Overall, the word cloud reflects a politically and ethnically charged atmosphere within the dataset."

    " Words like kikuyus, luo, kalenjins, and kenya are dominant in all three categories, highlighting the focus on Kenyan ethnic groups and politics. Hate speech tweets prominently feature tribal identifiers and words associated with violence or negativity, such as kill and hate, indicating targeted hostility. Neutral tweets, in contrast, also center around ethnic groups but with additional election-related terms like morefromselections and election, suggesting a broader, less aggressive discourse. Offensive tweets show a mix of slurs, ethnic mentions, and aggression-related words, though with less concentration on elections compared to neutral tweets. Overall, these visualizations underline the central role of ethnicity and politics in shaping online discourse across all sentiments."
